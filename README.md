# hello-world
I am a Computer Science Major here Claflin University.
Hello Everyone!

I like fast cars and new technology.
I've had pancakes at IHOP and find them better then Denny's.
public class HelloWorld{

     public static void main(String []args){
         double a, b, answer;
         a = 0.07;
         b = 30.89;
         answer = a * b + b;
         System.out.println(answer = a * b + b);
     }
}
